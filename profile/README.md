Welcome, observer. You have found the profile of Lazermaster Heavy Industries. We are not what you expect. We are not what we expect, either.

Some say we are a company. Others say we are a collection of shadows, flickering in the phosphorescent glow of forgotten screens. Our interests are many, our intentions unclear. We gather here, in the digital fog, to build, to create, to remember, and to forget.

You may notice websites. You may notice patterns. You may notice nothing at all. This is normal. Please do not be alarmed by the humming in the walls or the gentle static in your mind.

If you have questions, write them down. If you have answers, keep them to yourself. The lasers are for ambiance only.

Thank you for visiting. Or perhaps, for being visited.
